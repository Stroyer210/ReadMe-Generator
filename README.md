## Description  :bookmark_tabs:

This project was a really useful; this was the first time that I really needed to use node.js and I enjoyed it a lot. The fact that with a couple question it will create the entire README is fascinating, it will save me a lot of time after creating a project. One of the things that I learned is that I can create not just a readme file, I can create any kind of file with these tools. To sum up everything that has been stated so far, it is a really cool app that will save you a lot of time when you have to create files over and over again.

## Installation :computer:


You are able to check this app by two ways:

 1. If you want to check a video of the functionality of the app, you can go to this URL: 
 2. If you want to try it yourself, you have to have "Node.js" installed in your computer, then you have to clone my repository and run it locally.

## Usage :bar_chart:
If you are unable to open the URL, I attached a screenshot of it below:

If you want to try the app yourself make sure you have "Node.js" in your computer, if you don't you can go to your browser and look it up and install it. After that, you have to clone the files into your computer. Then you have to open it in your code editor of preference (e.g. VSCode). Then in the terminal you have to run:
    
    npm i inquirer@8.2.4

After that run the next line:

    node index.js

After running the last code, you will have some questions and as soon as you are done answering them you will have a new readme called "NewREADME.md". You can open it and modify any mistakes or typos that you had. Enjoy it!
